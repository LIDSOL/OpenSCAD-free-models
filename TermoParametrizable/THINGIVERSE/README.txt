# Summary

I needed some threaded rods and didn't find a good library here. As OpenSCAD is not well enough equipped to do threaded stuff having small slope, I decided to write my own code, using some sweep() functionality I had published earlier with my [Naca_sweep.scad library](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:900137). 


# How I Designed This

Solutions based on sweep() are usually pretty fast, also with F6. To get a properly closed manifold, which is not so easy to do with sweep(), I used some tricky union to glue two 180Â° extrusions together.
The lib has a lot of possibilities, some of them shown in the example collection *Threads.stl*. I tried to keep the footprint of the code small, so I just added help() and an example selector for more convenience. By looking at the example calls you will find inspiration for your application. 

Features
- help()
- example selector
- specify pitch, windings (integer), diameter, and angle of attack along your needs. 
- multiple helices 
- rods and nuts have same calling syntax

To explore the examples you can write: 
```
include <Threading.scad>
showexample = 2;  // =0: no example shown, =1 ... =10: shows example#
help();   // display prototypes in library with parameter explanation
```

Usage of library in own code: 
```
use <Threading.scad>
threading(pitch = 2, d=20, windings = 30, angle = 20, full = true);

// M8 hex bolt CCW
mirror([1,0,0])
union(){ 
threading(pitch = 1.25, d=8, windings=20, full=true); cylinder(d=14.6, h=4, $fn=6);
} 
```
